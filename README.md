# turtle_crossing

You need to install tkinter if the program crashes on start. It happens on Linux and MacOS.

Install python-tk on MacOS:
```
brew install python-tk
```
Install python-tk on Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install python-tk
```

Gameplay: press Up arrow if you want to move forward. You can only move forward no backward or sideways movement allowed! The goal is to move with the turtle to the other side of the road. If you succeed, the speed of the cars are increasing.

Enjoy!
